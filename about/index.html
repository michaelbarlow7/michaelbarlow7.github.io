<ul>
<li>I develop software, specialising in Android apps, so that's primarily what this website is focussed on.</li>
<li>I identify more with the old-school "hacker" mentality of solving problems in creative and interesting ways than the current trend of using technology for the sake of technology, or making Tools to Make Tools, or trying to solve problems that barely exist. </li>
<li>I don't believe technology can solve every problem. We shouldn't be trying to put technology where it doesn't belong, which seems to be the current trend of startups jostling with each other to try and make it big.</li>
<li>That said, I take inspiration from clever and interesting hacks, like this DIY <a href="https://spritesmods.com/?art=mcportal">Minecraft portal</a>.</li>
<li>I also love the idea of open-source software. I have contributed to a couple of projects in the past to scratch a few itches, but would like to do this more.</li>
<li>I enjoy learning how things work. </li>
<li>Whilst I enjoy developing software, I wouldn't call myself a fanatic. You won't see me wearing a T-shirt evangelising the latest framework, or carrying a laptop covered in tech stickers.</li>
<li>I much prefer reading articles than listening to talks or podcasts, or going to conferences.</li>
<li>I love listening to music. I love indie and rock, but also electro and techno. See my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/marzzbar">last.fm profile</a> if you want to see what I'm listening to.</li>
<li>I also love games, of both the computer and board variety.</li>
<li>I live for good music and good people, ideally both at the same time</li>
<li>A fun and interesting work environment, with people I get along with, makes for a worthwhile job.</li>
<li>I'm actually pretty easy-going, and have been told that I communicate and work well in a team.</li>
<li>I don't have twitter, but I do have a <a href="au.linkedin.com/in/mbarlow7">LinkedIn profile</a>, and here's my <a href="https://github.com/michaelbarlow7/">Github</a>.</li>
<li>I believe you should use whatever tools suit you best. Opinions are fine, but it's not worth holding onto them too strongly, or shouting them too loudly at the behest of others. I think it's more important to stay open to other tools and technologies, and stay flexible.</li>
<li>That said, I quite enjoy VIM keybindings, and try to use them wherever possible.</li>
<li>I enjoy browsing <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>. My profile name is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=barbs">barbs</a></li>
<li>I can't stand arrogance and ego. I hope that doesn't sound hypocritical!</li>

<h2>This site</h2>
<p>The aim of this site is to keep it simple, small and responsive. As you can tell, the focus is on content and function rather than style. The driving philosophy behind it can be summarised by <a href="http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a> (contains profanity).</p>
<p>Other influences include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.icculus.org/">icculus.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/">maddox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz's blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.edcollins.com">Ed Collins' website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I made this website in Flask, primarily to learn the framework, but it ended up being way simpler than I expected. I could use <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen Flask</a> to turn it into a static website but I may make it somewhat functional in the future.</p>
<p>I'm kind of writing what I feel like and letting the structure evolve on its own. At this stage it's just a bunch of articles, sort of like a blog, but where the content itself is more important than any chronological order, sort of like <a href="http://www.edcollins.com">Ed Collins' website</a>. I also always prefer light text on a dark background.</p>
